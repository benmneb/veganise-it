### [Launch app ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://veganise.it)

Even though it's all one git repository, both the `api` and `app` folders are completely seperate projects as far as `yarn` is concerned.

#### To deploy front-end `app` updates to Netlify

Just push to `master` branch.

#### To deploy `api` updates to Heroku

Use

```
git subtree push --prefix api heroku master
```

because Heroku [does not officially support](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs/issues/385) deploying from sub-directories.
